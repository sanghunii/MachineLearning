##These are basic models of regression

##Regression model predicts a numerical value for something.

##Caution!! Logistic Regression is classify model although using 'regression' for the name

##Than, why we call Logistic 'Regression' this model despite it is classify model
  -> Logistic regression is named as such because it builds on the regression framework to estimate the parameters (coefficients) and involves a regression-like calculation of the weighted sum of inputs. Despite its primary application being classification, the underlying principles and historical development align it closely with regression techniques.
